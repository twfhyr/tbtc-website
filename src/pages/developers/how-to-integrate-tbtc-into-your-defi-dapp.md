tBTC is the easy way to add Bitcoin to your dapp, making it accessible to BTC holders and unlocking user growth. By integrating TBTC, developers of DeFi dapps on Ethereum can let BTC holders earn interest or take out loans without having to trust centralized services.

tBTC is an open-source project with many contributors. Developers can integrate TBTC into their dapps using publicly available resources and libraries. Any app that uses an ERC-20 token can integrate TBTC.

Developers will need to be familiar with Solidity and with ERC-20 tokens generally.

The following resources contain the tools needed to integrate TBTC, as well as a brief guide:

- [The Ropsten-connected tBTC dapp](https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-dapp) (use the [tBTC dapp on testnet](https://dapp.test.tbtc.network/) here)
- [tBTC smart contracts](https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc)
- [tbtc.js](https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc.js)
- [The technical specification](http://docs.keep.network/tbtc/)
- [The Solidity API documentation](http://docs.keep.network/tbtc/solidity/)

Developers are already building on tBTC using the tools above. Our recent hackathon at ETHDenver [produced several excellent applications](https://blog.keep.network/bitcoin-earn-wins-ethdenver-tbtc-hackathon-prize-5233ce805468) that may provide inspiration.

Join the [Keep #tbtc channel on Discord](https://discord.gg/wYezN7v) for technical questions about tBTC and [tbtc.js](https://tbtc.network/news/2020-02-14-announcing-tbtc-js)

The following additional resources are also available:

- Join the tBTC mailing list (for updates including information about tBTC&#39;s upcoming launch on Ethereum mainnet)
- tBTC&#39;s [GitHub](https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc)
- The [technical spec](http://docs.keep.network/tbtc/index.pdf)
